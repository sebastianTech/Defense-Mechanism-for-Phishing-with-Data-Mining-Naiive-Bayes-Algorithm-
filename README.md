Naïve Bayesian is based on Bayes theorem. It is a statistical classifier that performs probabilistic predictions. A simple Bayesian classifier, Naïve Bayesian classifier, has comparable performance with decision tree. Given a training data X, posterior probability of a hypothesis H, P(H|X), follows the Bayes theorem
